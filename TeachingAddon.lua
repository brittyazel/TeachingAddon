--- Called directly after the addon is fully loaded.
--- We do initialization tasks here, such as loading our saved variables or setting up slash commands.
function TeachingAddon:OnInitialize()
	-- empty --
end

--- Called during the PLAYER_LOGIN event when most of the data provided by the game is already present.
--- We perform more startup tasks here, such as registering events, hooking functions, creating frames, or getting 
--- information from the game that wasn't yet available during :OnInitialize()
function TeachingAddon:OnEnable()

	--- Example Function Call
	self:ExampleFunc()

end

--- Called when our addon is manually being disabled during a running session.
--- We primarily use this to unhook scripts, unregister events, or hide frames that we created.
